"""Bio.SeqIO support for the FASTQ and QUAL file formats.

Note that you are expected to use this code via the Bio.SeqIO interface, as
shown below.

The FASTQ file format is used frequently at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute
to bundle a FASTA sequence and its PHRED quality data (integers between 0 and
90).  Rather than using a single FASTQ file, often paired FASTA and QUAL files
are used containing the sequence and the quality information separately.

The PHRED software reads DNA sequencing trace files, calls bases, and
assigns a non-negative quality value to each called base using a logged
transformation of the error probability, Q = -10 log10( Pe ), for example::

    Pe = 1.0,         Q =  0
    Pe = 0.1,         Q = 10
    Pe = 0.01,        Q = 20
    ...
    Pe = 0.00000001,  Q = 80
    Pe = 0.000000001, Q = 90

In typical raw sequence reads, the PHRED quality valuea will be from 0 to 40.
In the QUAL format these quality values are held as space separated text in
a FASTA like file format.  In the FASTQ format, each quality values is encoded
with a single ASCI character using chr(Q+33), meaning zero maps to the
character "!" and for example 80 maps to "q".  For the Sanger FASTQ standard
the allowed range of PHRED scores is 0 to 93 inclusive. The sequences and
quality are then stored in pairs in a FASTA like format.

Unfortunately there is no official document describing the FASTQ file format,
and worse, several related but different variants exist. For more details,
please read this open access publication::

    The Sanger FASTQ file format for sequences with quality scores, and the
    Solexa/Illumina FASTQ variants.
    P.J.A.Cock (Biopython), C.J.Fields (BioPerl), N.Goto (BioRuby),
    M.L.Heuer (BioJava) and P.M. Rice (EMBOSS).

    https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp1137

The good news is that Roche 454 sequencers can output files in the QUAL format,
and sensibly they use PHREP style scores like Sanger.  Converting a pair of
FASTA and QUAL files into a Sanger style FASTQ file is easy. To extract QUAL
files from a Roche 454 SFF binary file, use the Roche off instrument command
line tool "sffinfo" with the -q or -qual argument.  You can extract a matching
FASTA file using the -s or -seq argument instead.

The bad news is that Solexa/Illumina did things differently - they have their
own scoring system AND their own incompatible versions of the FASTQ format.
Solexa/Illumina quality scores use Q = - 10 log10 ( Pe / (1-Pe) ), which can
be negative.  PHRED scores and Solexa scores are NOT interchangeable (but a
reasonable mapping can be achieved between them, and they are approximately
equal for higher quality reads).

Confusingly early Solexa pipelines produced a FASTQ like file but using their
own score mapping and an ASCII offset of 64. To make things worse, for the
Solexa/Illumina pipeline 1.3 onwards, they introduced a third variant of the
FASTQ file format, this time using PHRED scores (which is more consistent) but
with an ASCII offset of 64.

i.e. There are at least THREE different and INCOMPATIBLE variants of the FASTQ
file format: The original Sanger PHRED standard, and two from Solexa/Illumina.

The good news is that as of CASAVA version 1.8, Illumina sequencers will
produce FASTQ files using the standard Sanger encoding.

You are expected to use this module via the Bio.SeqIO functions, with the
following format names:

    - "qual" means simple quality files using PHRED scores (e.g. from Roche 454)
    - "fastq" means Sanger style FASTQ files using PHRED scores and an ASCII
      offset of 33 (e.g. from the NCBI Short Read Archive and Illumina 1.8+).
      These can potentially hold PHRED scores from 0 to 93.
    - "fastq-sanger" is an alias for "fastq".
    - "fastq-solexa" means old Solexa (and also very early Illumina) style FASTQ
      files, using Solexa scores with an ASCII offset 64. These can hold Solexa
      scores from -5 to 62.
    - "fastq-illumina" means newer Illumina 1.3 to 1.7 style FASTQ files, using
      PHRED scores but with an ASCII offset 64, allowing PHRED scores from 0
      to 62.

We could potentially add support for "qual-solexa" meaning QUAL files which
contain Solexa scores, but thus far there isn't any reason to use such files.

For example, consider the following short FASTQ file::

    @EAS54_6_R1_2_1_413_324
    CCCTTCTTGTCTTCAGCGTTTCTCC
    +
    ;;3;;;;;;;;;;;;7;;;;;;;88
    @EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792

    GTTGCTTCTGGCGTGGGTGGGGGGG
    +
    ;;;;;;;;;;;9;7;;.7;393333

This contains three reads of length 25.  From the read length these were
probably originally from an early Solexa/Illumina sequencer but this file
follows the Sanger FASTQ convention (PHRED style qualities with an ASCII
offet of 33).  This means we can parse this file using Bio.SeqIO using
"fastq" as the format name:

>>> from Bio import SeqIO
>>> for record in SeqIO.parse("Quality/example.fastq", "fastq"):
...     print("%s %s" % (record.id, record.seq))
EAS54_6_R1_2_1_413_324 CCCTTCTTGTCTTCAGCGTTTCTCC
EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792 TTGGCAGGCCAAGGCCGATGGATCA
EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348 GTTGCTTCTGGCGTGGGTGGGGGGG

The qualities are held as a list of integers in each record's annotation:

>>> print(record)
ID: EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
Name: EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
Description: EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
Number of features: 0
Per letter annotation for: phred_quality
Seq('GTTGCTTCTGGCGTGGGTGGGGGGG')
>>> print(record.letter_annotations["phred_quality"])
[26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 24, 26, 22, 26, 26, 13, 22, 26, 18, 24, 18, 18, 18, 18]

You can use the SeqRecord format method to show this in the QUAL format:

>>> print(record.format("qual"))
>EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 24 26 22 26 26 13 22 26 18
24 18 18 18 18
<BLANKLINE>

Or go back to the FASTQ format, use "fastq" (or "fastq-sanger"):

>>> print(record.format("fastq"))
@EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
GTTGCTTCTGGCGTGGGTGGGGGGG
+
;;;;;;;;;;;9;7;;.7;393333
<BLANKLINE>

Or, using the Illumina 1.3+ FASTQ encoding (PHRED values with an ASCII offset
of 64):

>>> print(record.format("fastq-illumina"))
@EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
GTTGCTTCTGGCGTGGGTGGGGGGG
+
ZZZZZZZZZZZXZVZZMVZRXRRRR
<BLANKLINE>

You can also get Biopython to convert the scores and show a Solexa style
FASTQ file:

>>> print(record.format("fastq-solexa"))
@EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
GTTGCTTCTGGCGTGGGTGGGGGGG
+
ZZZZZZZZZZZXZVZZMVZRXRRRR
<BLANKLINE>

Notice that this is actually the same output as above using "fastq-illumina"
as the format! The reason for this is all these scores are high enough that
the PHRED and Solexa scores are almost equal. The differences become apparent
for poor quality reads. See the functions solexa_quality_from_phred and
phred_quality_from_solexa for more details.

If you wanted to trim your sequences (perhaps to remove low quality regions,
or to remove a primer sequence), try slicing the SeqRecord objects.  e.g.

>>> sub_rec = record[5:15]
>>> print(sub_rec)
ID: EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
Name: EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
Description: EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
Number of features: 0
Per letter annotation for: phred_quality
Seq('TTCTGGCGTG')
>>> print(sub_rec.letter_annotations["phred_quality"])
[26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 24, 26, 22, 26]
>>> print(sub_rec.format("fastq"))
@EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
TTCTGGCGTG
+
;;;;;;9;7;
<BLANKLINE>

If you wanted to, you could read in this FASTQ file, and save it as a QUAL file:

>>> from Bio import SeqIO
>>> record_iterator = SeqIO.parse("Quality/example.fastq", "fastq")
>>> with open("Quality/temp.qual", "w") as out_handle:
...     SeqIO.write(record_iterator, out_handle, "qual")
3

You can of course read in a QUAL file, such as the one we just created:

>>> from Bio import SeqIO
>>> for record in SeqIO.parse("Quality/temp.qual", "qual"):
...     print("%s read of length %d" % (record.id, len(record.seq)))
EAS54_6_R1_2_1_413_324 read of length 25
EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792 read of length 25
EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348 read of length 25

Notice that QUAL files don't have a proper sequence present!  But the quality
information is there:

>>> print(record)
ID: EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
Name: EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
Description: EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348
Number of features: 0
Per letter annotation for: phred_quality
Undefined sequence of length 25
>>> print(record.letter_annotations["phred_quality"])
[26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 24, 26, 22, 26, 26, 13, 22, 26, 18, 24, 18, 18, 18, 18]

Just to keep things tidy, if you are following this example yourself, you can
delete this temporary file now:

>>> import os
>>> os.remove("Quality/temp.qual")

Sometimes you won't have a FASTQ file, but rather just a pair of FASTA and QUAL
files.  Because the Bio.SeqIO system is designed for reading single files, you
would have to read the two in separately and then combine the data.  However,
since this is such a common thing to want to do, there is a helper iterator
defined in this module that does this for you - PairedFastaQualIterator.

Alternatively, if you have enough RAM to hold all the records in memory at once,
then a simple dictionary approach would work:

>>> from Bio import SeqIO
>>> reads = SeqIO.to_dict(SeqIO.parse("Quality/example.fasta", "fasta"))
>>> for rec in SeqIO.parse("Quality/example.qual", "qual"):
...     reads[rec.id].letter_annotations["phred_quality"]=rec.letter_annotations["phred_quality"]

You can then access any record by its key, and get both the sequence and the
quality scores.

>>> print(reads["EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792"].format("fastq"))
@EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792
TTGGCAGGCCAAGGCCGATGGATCA

;;;;;;;;;;;7;;;;;-;;;3;83
<BLANKLINE>

It is important that you explicitly tell Bio.SeqIO which FASTQ variant you are
using ("fastq" or "fastq-sanger" for the Sanger standard using PHRED values,
"fastq-solexa" for the original Solexa/Illumina variant, or "fastq-illumina"
for the more recent variant), as this cannot be detected reliably
automatically.

To illustrate this problem, let's consider an artificial example:

>>> from Bio.Seq import Seq
>>> from Bio.SeqRecord import SeqRecord
>>> test = SeqRecord(Seq("NACGTACGTA"), id="Test", description="Made up!")
>>> print(test.format("fasta"))
>Test Made up!
NACGTACGTA
<BLANKLINE>
>>> print(test.format("fastq"))
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
ValueError: No suitable quality scores found in letter_annotations of SeqRecord (id=Test).

We created a sample SeqRecord, and can show it in FASTA format - but for QUAL
or FASTQ format we need to provide some quality scores. These are held as a
list of integers (one for each base) in the letter_annotations dictionary:

>>> test.letter_annotations["phred_quality"] = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40]
>>> print(test.format("qual"))
>Test Made up!
0 1 2 3 4 5 10 20 30 40
<BLANKLINE>
>>> print(test.format("fastq"))
@Test Made up!
NACGTACGTA
+
!"#$%&+5?I
<BLANKLINE>

We can check this FASTQ encoding - the first PHRED quality was zero, and this
mapped to a exclamation mark, while the final score was 40 and this mapped to
the letter "I":

>>> ord('!') - 33
0
>>> ord('I') - 33
40
>>> [ord(letter)-33 for letter in '!"#$%&+5?I']
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40]

Similarly, we could produce an Illumina 1.3 to 1.7 style FASTQ file using PHRED
scores with an offset of 64:

>>> print(test.format("fastq-illumina"))
@Test Made up!
NACGTACGTA
+
@ABCDEJT^h
<BLANKLINE>

And we can check this too - the first PHRED score was zero, and this mapped to
"@", while the final score was 40 and this mapped to "h":

>>> ord("@") - 64
0
>>> ord("h") - 64
40
>>> [ord(letter)-64 for letter in "@ABCDEJT^h"]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40]

Notice how different the standard Sanger FASTQ and the Illumina 1.3 to 1.7 style
FASTQ files look for the same data! Then we have the older Solexa/Illumina
format to consider which encodes Solexa scores instead of PHRED scores.

First let's see what Biopython says if we convert the PHRED scores into Solexa
scores (rounding to one decimal place):

>>> for q in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40]:
...     print("PHRED %i maps to Solexa %0.1f" % (q, solexa_quality_from_phred(q)))
PHRED 0 maps to Solexa -5.0
PHRED 1 maps to Solexa -5.0
PHRED 2 maps to Solexa -2.3
PHRED 3 maps to Solexa -0.0
PHRED 4 maps to Solexa 1.8
PHRED 5 maps to Solexa 3.3
PHRED 10 maps to Solexa 9.5
PHRED 20 maps to Solexa 20.0
PHRED 30 maps to Solexa 30.0
PHRED 40 maps to Solexa 40.0

Now here is the record using the old Solexa style FASTQ file:

>>> print(test.format("fastq-solexa"))
@Test Made up!
NACGTACGTA
+
;;>@BCJT^h
<BLANKLINE>

Again, this is using an ASCII offset of 64, so we can check the Solexa scores:

>>> [ord(letter)-64 for letter in ";;>@BCJT^h"]
[-5, -5, -2, 0, 2, 3, 10, 20, 30, 40]

This explains why the last few letters of this FASTQ output matched that using
the Illumina 1.3 to 1.7 format - high quality PHRED scores and Solexa scores
are approximately equal.

def solexa_quality_from_phred(phred_quality): # -> float | None:
    """Covert a PHRED quality (range 0 to about 90) to a Solexa quality.

    PHRED and Solexa quality scores are both log transformations of a
    probality of error (high score = low probability of error). This function
    takes a PHRED score, transforms it back to a probability of error, and
    then re-expresses it as a Solexa score. This assumes the error estimates
    are equivalent.

    How does this work exactly? Well the PHRED quality is minus ten times the
    base ten logarithm of the probability of error::

        phred_quality = -10*log(error,10)

    Therefore, turning this round::

        error = 10 ** (- phred_quality / 10)

    Now, Solexa qualities use a different log transformation::

        solexa_quality = -10*log(error/(1-error),10)

    After substitution and a little manipulation we get::

         solexa_quality = 10*log(10**(phred_quality/10.0) - 1, 10)

    However, real Solexa files use a minimum quality of -5. This does have a
    good reason - a random base call would be correct 25% of the time,
    and thus have a probability of error of 0.75, which gives 1.25 as the PHRED
    quality, or -4.77 as the Solexa quality. Thus (after rounding), a random
    nucleotide read would have a PHRED quality of 1, or a Solexa quality of -5.

    Taken literally, this logarithic formula would map a PHRED quality of zero
    to a Solexa quality of minus infinity. Of course, taken literally, a PHRED
    score of zero means a probability of error of one (i.e. the base call is
    definitely wrong), which is worse than random! In practice, a PHRED quality
    of zero usually means a default value, or perhaps random - and therefore
    mapping it to the minimum Solexa score of -5 is reasonable.

    In conclusion, we follow EMBOSS, and take this logarithmic formula but also
    apply a minimum value of -5.0 for the Solexa quality, and also map a PHRED
    quality of zero to -5.0 as well.

    Note this function will return a floating point number, it is up to you to
    round this to the nearest integer if appropriate.  e.g.

    >>> print("%0.2f" % round(solexa_quality_from_phred(80), 2))
    80.00
    >>> print("%0.2f" % round(solexa_quality_from_phred(50), 2))
    50.00
    >>> print("%0.2f" % round(solexa_quality_from_phred(20), 2))
    19.96
    >>> print("%0.2f" % round(solexa_quality_from_phred(10), 2))
    9.54
    >>> print("%0.2f" % round(solexa_quality_from_phred(5), 2))
    3.35
    >>> print("%0.2f" % round(solexa_quality_from_phred(4), 2))
    1.80
    >>> print("%0.2f" % round(solexa_quality_from_phred(3), 2))
    -0.02
    >>> print("%0.2f" % round(solexa_quality_from_phred(2), 2))
    -2.33
    >>> print("%0.2f" % round(solexa_quality_from_phred(1), 2))
    -5.00
    >>> print("%0.2f" % round(solexa_quality_from_phred(0), 2))
    -5.00

    Notice that for high quality reads PHRED and Solexa scores are numerically
    equal. The differences are important for poor quality reads, where PHRED
    has a minimum of zero but Solexa scores can be negative.

    Finally, as a special case where None is used for a "missing value", None
    is returned:

    >>> print(solexa_quality_from_phred(None))
    None

    This code does not try to interpret the quality string numerically.  It
    just returns tuples of the title, sequence and quality as strings.  For
    the sequence and quality, any whitespace (such as new lines) is removed.

    Our SeqRecord based FASTQ iterators call this function internally, and then
    turn the strings into a SeqRecord objects, mapping the quality string into

    then you might consider calling this function directly.

    For parsing FASTQ files, the title string from the "@" line at the start
    of each record can optionally be omitted on the "+" lines.  If it is
    repeated, it must be identical.

    The sequence string and the quality string can optionally be split over
    multiple lines, although several sources discourage this.  In comparison,
    for the FASTA file format line breaks between 60 and 80 characters are
    the norm.

    **WARNING** - Because the "@" character can appear in the quality string,
    this can cause problems as this is also the marker for the start of
    a new sequence.  In fact, the "+" sign can also appear as well.  Some

    This is four PHRED encoded FASTQ entries originally from an NCBI source
    (given the read length of 36, these are probably Solexa Illumina reads where
    the quality has been mapped onto the PHRED values).

    This example has been edited to illustrate some of the nasty things allowed
    in the FASTQ format.  Firstly, on the "+" lines most but not all of the
    (redundant) identifiers are omitted.  In real files it is likely that all or
    none of these extra identifiers will be present.

    Secondly, while the first three sequences have been shown without line
    breaks, the last has been split over multiple lines.  In real files any line
    breaks are likely to be consistent.

    Thirdly, some of the quality string lines start with an "@" character.  For
    the second record this is unavoidable.  However for the fourth sequence this
    only happens because its quality string is split over two lines.  A naive
    parser could wrongly treat any line starting with an "@" as the beginning of
    a new sequence!  This code copes with this possible ambiguity by keeping
    track of the length of the sequence which gives the expected length of the
    quality string.

    Using this tricky example file as input, this short bit of code demonstrates
    what this parsing function would return:

    >>> with open("Quality/tricky.fastq") as handle:
    ...     for (title, sequence, quality) in FastqGeneralIterator(handle):
    ...         print(title)
    ...         print("%s %s" % (sequence, quality))

    Finally we note that some sources state that the quality string should
    start with "!" (which using the PHRED mapping means the first letter always
    has a quality score of zero).  This rather restrictive rule is not widely
    observed, so is therefore ignored here.  One plus point about this "!" rule
    is that (provided there are no line breaks in the quality sequence) it
    would prevent the above problem with the "@" character.

        Arguments:
         - source - input stream opened in text mode, or a path to a file
         - alphabet - optional alphabet, no longer used. Leave as None.
         - title2ids - A function that, when given the title line from the FASTQ
           file (without the beginning >), will return the id, name and
           description (in that order) for the record as a tuple of strings.
           If this is not given, then the entire title line will be used as
           the description, and the first word as the id and name.

        Note that use of title2ids matches that of Bio.SeqIO.FastaIO.

        For each sequence in a (Sanger style) FASTQ file there is a matching string
        encoding the PHRED qualities (integers between 0 and about 90) using ASCII
        values with an offset of 33.

        For example, consider a file containing three short reads::

            @EAS54_6_R1_2_1_413_324

        For each sequence (e.g. "CCCTTCTTGTCTTCAGCGTTTCTCC") there is a matching
        string encoding the PHRED qualities using a ASCII values with an offset of
        33 (e.g. ";;3;;;;;;;;;;;;7;;;;;;;88").

        Using this module directly you might run:

        (or "fastq-sanger") as the format:

        If you want to look at the qualities, they are record in each record's
        per-letter-annotation dictionary as a simple list of integers:

        >>> print(record.letter_annotations["phred_quality"])

    If you want to look at the qualities, they are recorded in each record's
    per-letter-annotation dictionary as a simple list of integers:

    >>> print(record.letter_annotations["solexa_quality"])
    [25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 23, 25, 25, 25, 25, 23, 25, 23, 23, 21, 23, 23, 23, 17, 17]

    These scores aren't very good, but they are high enough that they map
    almost exactly onto PHRED scores:

    >>> print("%0.2f" % phred_quality_from_solexa(25))
    25.01

    Let's look at faked example read which is even worse, where there are
    more noticeable differences between the Solexa and PHRED scores::

         @slxa_0001_1_0001_01
         ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTNNNNNN
         +slxa_0001_1_0001_01
         hgfedcba`_^]\[ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA@?>=<;

    Again, you would typically use Bio.SeqIO to read this file in (rather than
    calling the Bio.SeqIO.QualtityIO module directly).  Most FASTQ files will
    contain thousands of reads, so you would normally use Bio.SeqIO.parse()
    as shown above.  This example has only as one entry, so instead we can
    use the Bio.SeqIO.read() function:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> with open("Quality/solexa_faked.fastq") as handle:
    ...     record = SeqIO.read(handle, "fastq-solexa")
    >>> print("%s %s" % (record.id, record.seq))
    slxa_0001_1_0001_01 ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTNNNNNN
    >>> print(record.letter_annotations["solexa_quality"])
    [40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5]

    These quality scores are so low that when converted from the Solexa scheme
    into PHRED scores they look quite different:

    >>> print("%0.2f" % phred_quality_from_solexa(-1))
    2.54
    >>> print("%0.2f" % phred_quality_from_solexa(-5))
    1.19

    Note you can use the Bio.SeqIO.write() function or the SeqRecord's format
    method to output the record(s):

    >>> print(record.format("fastq-solexa"))
    @slxa_0001_1_0001_01
    ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTNNNNNN
    +
    hgfedcba`_^]\[ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA@?>=<;
    <BLANKLINE>

    Note this output is slightly different from the input file as Biopython
    has left out the optional repetition of the sequence identifier on the "+"
    line.  If you want the to use PHRED scores, use "fastq" or "qual" as the
    output format instead, and Biopython will do the conversion for you:

    >>> print(record.format("fastq"))
    @slxa_0001_1_0001_01
    ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTNNNNNN
    +
    IHGFEDCBA@?>=<;:9876543210/.-,++*)('&&%%$$##""

    >>> print(record.format("qual"))

    1 1
    <BLANKLINE>

    As shown above, the poor quality Solexa reads have been mapped to the
    equivalent PHRED score (e.g. -5 to 1 as shown earlier).

    function instead via the format name "fastq" or the alias "fastq-sanger".

    For example, this code reads in a standard Sanger style FASTQ file

    Biopython will have each sequence on a single line, and each quality
    string on a single line (which is considered desirable for maximum
    compatibility).

    In this next example, an old style Solexa/Illumina FASTQ file (using Solexa

    PHRED qualities:

    >>> with open("Quality/temp.fastq", "w") as out_handle:
    ...     SeqIO.write(record_iterator, out_handle, "fastq")
    5

    This code is also called if you use the .format("fastq") method of a
    SeqRecord, or .format("fastq-sanger") if you prefer that alias.

    Note that Sanger FASTQ files have an upper limit of PHRED quality 93, which is
    encoded as ASCII 126, the tilde. If your quality scores are truncated to fit, a
    warning is issued.

class FastqSolexaWriter(SequenceWriter):
    r"""Write old style Solexa/Illumina FASTQ format files (with Solexa qualities) (OBSOLETE).

    This outputs FASTQ files like those from the early Solexa/Illumina
    pipeline, using Solexa scores and an ASCII offset of 64. These are
    NOT compatible with the standard Sanger style PHRED FASTQ files.

    If your records contain a "solexa_quality" entry under letter_annotations,
    this is used, otherwise any "phred_quality" entry will be used after
    conversion using the solexa_quality_from_phred function. If neither style
    of quality scores are present, an exception is raised.

    Although you can use this class directly, you are strongly encouraged
    to use the ``as_fastq_solexa`` function, or top-level ``Bio.SeqIO.write()``
    function instead.  For example, this code reads in a FASTQ file and re-saves
    it as another FASTQ file:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> record_iterator = SeqIO.parse("Quality/solexa_example.fastq", "fastq-solexa")
    >>> with open("Quality/temp.fastq", "w") as out_handle:
    ...     SeqIO.write(record_iterator, out_handle, "fastq-solexa")
    5

    You might want to do this if the original file included extra line breaks,
    which (while valid) may not be supported by all tools.  The output file
    from Biopython will have each sequence on a single line, and each quality
    string on a single line (which is considered desirable for maximum
    compatibility).

    This code is also called if you use the .format("fastq-solexa") method of
    a SeqRecord. For example,

    >>> record = SeqIO.read("Quality/sanger_faked.fastq", "fastq-sanger")
    >>> print(record.format("fastq-solexa"))

    Note that Solexa FASTQ files have an upper limit of Solexa quality 62, which is
    encoded as ASCII 126, the tilde.  If your quality scores must be truncated to fit,
    a warning is issued.

    You can parse these separately using Bio.SeqIO with the "qual" and
    "fasta" formats, but then you'll get a group of SeqRecord objects with
    no sequence, and a matching group with the sequence but not the
    qualities.  Because it only deals with one input file handle, Bio.SeqIO
    can't be used to read the two files together - but this function can!
    For example,

    >>> with open("Quality/example.fasta") as f:
    ...     with open("Quality/example.qual") as q:
    ...         for record in PairedFastaQualIterator(f, q):
    ...             print("%s %s" % (record.id, record.seq))
    ...
    EAS54_6_R1_2_1_413_324 CCCTTCTTGTCTTCAGCGTTTCTCC
    EAS54_6_R1_2_1_540_792 TTGGCAGGCCAAGGCCGATGGATCA
    EAS54_6_R1_2_1_443_348 GTTGCTTCTGGCGTGGGTGGGGGGG

    As with the FASTQ or QUAL parsers, if you want to look at the qualities,
    they are in each record's per-letter-annotation dictionary as a simple
    list of integers:

    >>> print(record.letter_annotations["phred_quality"])
    [26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 24, 26, 22, 26, 26, 13, 22, 26, 18, 24, 18, 18, 18, 18]

    If you have access to data as a FASTQ format file, using that directly
    would be simpler and more straight forward.  Note that you can easily use
    this function to convert paired FASTA and QUAL files into FASTQ files:

    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> with open("Quality/example.fasta") as f:
    ...     with open("Quality/example.qual") as q:
    ...         SeqIO.write(PairedFastaQualIterator(f, q), "Quality/temp.fastq", "fastq")
    ...
    3

    And don't forget to clean up the temp file if you don't need it anymore:

    >>> import os
    >>> os.remove("Quality/temp.fastq")
