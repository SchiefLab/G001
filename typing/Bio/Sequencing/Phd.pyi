"""Parser for PHD files output by PHRED and used by PHRAP and CONSED.

This module can be used directly, which will return Record objects
containing all the original data in the file.

Alternatively, using Bio.SeqIO with the "phd" format will call this module
internally.  This will give SeqRecord objects for each contig sequence.
